## ü§î Common Questions About Hackathon Pitches

---

## üìã General Pitch Questions

### Q: How long should our presentation be?
**A:** Most hackathons allocate 5-7 minutes for presentation plus 2-3 minutes for Q&A. Always confirm with your specific hackathon organizers, but plan for 5-6 minutes of content with buffer time.

### Q: How many slides should we have?
**A:** Aim for 12-15 slides including title and backup slides. This allows roughly 20-30 seconds per slide, which is optimal for maintaining audience attention while covering all key points.

### Q: What if we don't have a working prototype?
**A:** You can still present effectively with:
- **Detailed mockups** showing user interface
- **Workflow diagrams** explaining functionality  
- **Market research** proving demand exists
- **Technical architecture** showing feasibility
- Focus on problem validation and solution design rather than implementation

### Q: Should everyone on the team present?
**A:** Not necessarily. It's better to have 2-3 strong speakers than 5 nervous ones. Consider:
- **Primary presenter** (40-50% of content)
- **Technical lead** (demo and technical questions)
- **Business lead** (market and business model)
- Others can support during Q&A
