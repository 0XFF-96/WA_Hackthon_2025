# Healthcare AI Platform - Project Structure

This is a healthcare AI platform focused on minimal trauma fracture (MTF) detection and osteoporosis risk management. The project follows a full-stack TypeScript architecture with React frontend and Express backend.

## Project Architecture

### Frontend (client/)
- **Framework**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI Library**: Radix UI + Tailwind CSS
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom healthcare design system

### Backend (server/)
- **Runtime**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o for multi-agent medical analysis
- **Authentication**: Express sessions with Passport.js

### Shared (shared/)
- **Schema**: Zod schemas for type-safe data validation
- **Types**: Shared TypeScript interfaces

## Key Directories

- `client/src/components/` - React components organized by feature
- `client/src/pages/` - Route components
- `client/src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `client/src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `client/src/lib/` - Utility functions and configurations
- `server/services/` - Business logic and AI services
- `shared/` - Shared schemas and types

## Design System

Follow the healthcare design guidelines in [design_guidelines.md](mdc:design_guidelines.md) which emphasizes:
- Professional medical interface standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Healthcare-specific color palette and typography
- Material Design principles adapted for medical use
