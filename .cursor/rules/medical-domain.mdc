# Medical Domain Guidelines

## Medical Terminology
This platform focuses on minimal trauma fracture (MTF) detection and osteoporosis risk management. Use proper medical terminology and follow clinical standards.

## Key Medical Concepts

### Minimal Trauma Fractures (MTF)
- Fractures caused by falls from standing height or lower
- Important warning signs for osteoporosis
- Require immediate specialist attention
- High risk of subsequent fractures

### Osteoporosis Risk Factors
- Age (especially >70 years)
- Previous fractures
- Family history of osteoporosis
- Low calcium intake
- Smoking
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Certain medications

### Medical Assessment Workflow
1. **Symptom Evaluation**: Pain location, severity, duration
2. **Functional Assessment**: Mobility, daily activities
3. **Risk Factor Analysis**: Medical history, lifestyle factors
4. **Clinical Decision Making**: AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment planning

## Medical Data Standards

### Patient Information
- Use proper medical record formats
- Implement HIPAA compliance
- Ensure data privacy and security
- Use standardized medical terminology

### Clinical Measurements
- Use appropriate units for medical measurements
- Implement proper validation for medical values
- Use clinical reference ranges
- Follow medical data standards

### Medical Imaging
- Support standard medical imaging formats
- Implement proper image analysis workflows
- Use appropriate medical imaging terminology
- Ensure image quality and resolution standards

## AI Medical Analysis

### Diagnostic Accuracy
- Implement evidence-based medical criteria
- Use proper clinical decision support
- Ensure AI recommendations are clinically appropriate
- Provide confidence levels for medical assessments

### Medical Safety
- Implement proper medical disclaimers
- Ensure AI recommendations are safe
- Provide appropriate medical warnings
- Follow medical AI safety guidelines

## Medical Workflow Integration

### Healthcare Provider Workflow
- Integrate with existing medical systems
- Support clinical decision making
- Provide appropriate medical alerts
- Ensure workflow efficiency

### Patient Communication
- Use clear, medical-appropriate language
- Provide patient education materials
- Ensure accessibility for elderly patients
- Support multiple communication channels

## Medical Compliance

### Regulatory Requirements
- Follow HIPAA compliance guidelines
- Implement proper medical data security
- Ensure patient privacy protection
- Follow medical device regulations

### Clinical Standards
- Use evidence-based medical practices
- Follow clinical guidelines for osteoporosis
- Implement proper medical documentation
- Ensure clinical quality standards

## Medical Error Prevention
- Implement proper medical data validation
- Use appropriate medical terminology
- Ensure clinical accuracy in AI responses
- Provide proper medical disclaimers
