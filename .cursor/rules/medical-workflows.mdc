# Medical Workflow Guidelines

## Workflow Components
This platform implements complex medical workflows for patient assessment, monitoring, and treatment planning.

## Assessment Workflow
Based on [client/src/components/assessment/](mdc:client/src/components/assessment/):

### Assessment Steps
1. **Symptom Scoring**: Pain location, severity, and onset
2. **Functional Check**: Mobility and daily activity impact
3. **Risk Factors**: Age, medical history, lifestyle factors
4. **Recent Events**: Fall history and impact mechanisms

### Assessment Data Structure
```typescript
interface AssessmentData {
  // Symptom Scoring
  painLocation: string[];
  painSeverity: number; // 0-10
  painStartDate: string;
  
  // Functional Check
  painWhenWalking: boolean;
  painWhenClimbing: boolean;
  limpingOrImbalance: boolean;
  
  // Risk Factors
  ageGroup: 'under-30' | '30-50' | '50-70' | 'over-70';
  osteoporosisHistory: boolean;
  previousFractures: boolean;
  smoking: boolean;
  lowCalciumIntake: boolean;
  
  // Recent Events
  recentFall: boolean;
  recentJump: boolean;
  recentImpact: boolean;
}
```

## Monitoring Workflow
Based on [client/src/components/monitoring/](mdc:client/src/components/monitoring/):

### Daily Monitoring
- Patient vitals tracking
- Pain level monitoring
- Activity level assessment
- Medication adherence tracking

### Monitoring Components
- **DailyInput**: Patient self-reporting interface
- **MonitoringDashboard**: Healthcare provider overview
- **MonitoringVisualization**: Data visualization and trends

## Workflow Visualization
Based on [client/src/components/workflow/](mdc:client/src/components/workflow/):

### Workflow Management
- Step-by-step progression tracking
- Status indicators for each workflow step
- Automated workflow routing based on medical criteria
- Integration with AI agent recommendations

## Medical Workflow Patterns

### Step Progression
```tsx
// Good: Medical workflow step with proper status
interface WorkflowStep {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'cancelled';
  timestamp: Date;
  description: string;
  medicalCriteria?: MedicalCriteria;
}
```

### Risk Assessment
- Implement proper medical risk scoring algorithms
- Use evidence-based medical criteria
- Provide clear risk level indicators
- Generate appropriate medical recommendations

### Patient Communication
- Use clear, medical-appropriate language
- Implement proper patient education materials
- Provide accessible interfaces for elderly patients
- Use multiple communication channels (phone, email, SMS)

## Medical Data Validation
- Validate all medical inputs against clinical standards
- Implement proper error handling for medical data
- Use appropriate medical terminology
- Ensure data integrity for medical records

## Accessibility for Medical Workflows
- Implement proper keyboard navigation
- Use high contrast for critical medical information
- Provide clear visual indicators for workflow status
- Ensure screen reader compatibility for medical data
