## üìã Demo Planning Framework

### 1. Demo Strategy Selection

#### Option A: Live Product Demo
**Best For**: Fully functional prototypes
**Pros**: Maximum credibility, real interaction
**Cons**: Technical risk, requires stable product
**Backup**: Screenshots and walkthrough

#### Option B: Prototype Walkthrough
**Best For**: MVP with core features working
**Pros**: Shows key functionality, manageable risk
**Cons**: Less impressive than full product
**Backup**: Recorded demo video

#### Option C: Concept Demo
**Best For**: Early-stage concepts or complex systems
**Pros**: Can show ambitious vision, lower technical risk
**Cons**: Less proof of execution capability
**Backup**: Animated mockups or slides

### 2. Demo Story Structure

#### Act 1: The Problem (30 seconds)
- Show current painful process
- Use real example or scenario
- Make problem visceral and relatable

#### Act 2: The Solution (90 seconds)
- Walk through your solution step-by-step
- Highlight key innovations and features
- Show smooth, intuitive user experience

#### Act 3: The Transformation (30 seconds)
- Demonstrate the improved outcome
- Quantify the improvement (time, cost, satisfaction)
- Connect back to original problem
